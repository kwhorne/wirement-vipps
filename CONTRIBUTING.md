# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/kwhorne/wirement-vipps).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-12-extended-coding-style-guide.md)** - Check the code style with ``$ composer check-style`` and fix it with ``$ composer fix-style``.

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

## Running Tests

```bash
composer test
```

## Code Style

We use Laravel Pint for code style. You can check and fix code style issues with:

```bash
composer check-style
composer fix-style
```

## Static Analysis

We use PHPStan for static analysis:

```bash
composer analyse
```

**Happy coding**!
